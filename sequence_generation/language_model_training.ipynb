    "A statistical language model is simply a probability distribution over sequences of words or characters [1].\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll restrict our attention to word-based language models.\n",
    "Given a reliable language model, we can answer questions like *which among the following strings are we more likely to encounter?*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 'On Monday, Mr. Lamar’s “DAMN.” took home an even more elusive honor,\n",
    "one that may never have even seemed within reach: the Pulitzer Prize\"\n",
    "1. \"Frog zealot flagged xylophone the bean wallaby anaphylaxis extraneous\n",

    "Even if we've never seen either of these sentences in our entire lives, and even though no rapper has previously been\n",
    "awarded a Pulitzer Prize, we wouldn't be shocked to see the first sentence in the New York Times.\n",
    "By comparison, we can all agree that the second sentence, consisting of incoherent babble, is comparatively unlikely.\n",
    "A statistical language model can assign precise probabilities to each string of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a large corpus of text, we can estimate (i.e. train) a language model $\\hat{p}(x_1, ..., x_n)$.\n",
    "And given such a model, we can sample strings $\\mathbf{x} \\sim \\hat{p}(x_1, ..., x_n)$, generating new strings according to their estimated probability.\n",
    "Among other useful applications, we can use language models to score candidate transcriptions from speech recognition models, given a preference to sentences that seem more probable (at the expense of those deemed anomalous).\n",
    "\n",
    "These days recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are the preferred method for LM. In this notebook, we will go through an example of using GluonNLP to\n",

    "(i) implement a typical LSTM language model architecture\n",
    "(ii) train the language model on a corpus of real data\n",
    "(iii) bring in your own dataset for training\n",
    "(iv) grab off-the-shelf pre-trained state-of-the-art language models (i.e., AWD language model) using GluonNLP.\n",

    "## Language model definition - one sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard approach to language modeling consists of training a model that given a trailing window of text, predicts the next word in the sequence.\n",
    "When we train the model we feed in the inputs $x_1, x_2, ...$ and try at each time step to predict the corresponding next word $x_2, ..., x_{n+1}$.\n",
    "To generate text from a language model, we can iteratively predict the next word, and then feed this word as an input to the model at the subsequent time step.\n",
